        <h3>About Me:</h3>
        <p>I'm passionate about creative game design, as well as elegant code. I have an education in game design
            from Kristiania's Vocational University in Oslo, and have worked with many various projects both 
            in large and small teams, as well as solo. I have experience with leading teams, 
            programming functional game systems, and designing engaging game mechanics.
            I've also worked with music and sound design, as I have been a musician for over 10 years.
            <p>I'm currently working as game director for an upcoming game called "Divine Design" at "Mistical Studios".
        </p>
        <h3>Proficiencies:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Unity Game Engine (Unity & DOTS)</li>
            <li>Game Design & Prototyping (Game Mechanics, Game Systems, Level Design, Story Design)</li>
            <li>Programming Languages (C#, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Java)</li>
            <li>Music Producing & Instruments (Ableton, Drums, Piano, Gutiar, Bass)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>These are my main points of expertise, but from years of experimenting, working with others
            in a school enviroment as well as online, in game jams and other small projects,
             I've learned a lot about all different aspects of game development, and have become
             a jack of many trades.
